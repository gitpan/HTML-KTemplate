CHANGES
-------

1.21  Wed May 21 17:28:00 2003
    - Added: option to include template files defined by a variable.

1.20  Sun May 11 02:42:00 2003
    - Added: if, else, unless and loop statements for a better control of the 
      template output and a cleaner template syntax.
    - Added: blind cache option for some speed improvement over normal caching.
    - Added: default loop context variables can be changed and are faster now.
    - Changed: chomp removes the newline before and after a block tag instead 
      of all preceding whitespace characters.
    - Changed: more detailed error messages and better syntax checking.
    - Fixed: inner loops had access to outer loop context variables what
      resulted in unexpected behavior.
    - Fixed: include function first checked the path to the enclosing file
      instead of the default file path.
