CHANGES
-------

1.33  Sun Nov 09 15:34 2003
    - Rewrite: some internal changes making this module faster.
    - Changed: chomped newlines are replaced with a single space as you would
      expect from a html template module.
    - Fixed: assigned undefined block variables were not used if a global
      variable with the same name existed.

1.32  Wed Oct 15 23:29 2003
    - New: mailing list available for announcements and discussion (see POD
      documentation for more information).
    - Fixed: process() method emptied scalar reference passed as template.
    - Fixed: references to undefined values are skipped instead of raising an
      error when passed to process() method.

1.31  Fri Oct 10 10:58 2003
    - Fixed: print() method accepts file hande for compatibility reasons.
    - Fixed: passing a file handle reference to process() did not work with
      older Perl versions.

1.30  Thu Oct 09 15:16 2003
    - Added: process() method accepts a reference to a scalar, array or file
      handle to initialize the template from memory.
    - Added: option to replace all template variables inside of a variable with
      their assigned values.
    - Added: block loops can be created with the assign() method.
    - Added: block() method accepts names as a list to create nested blocks.
    - Changed: file handle has to be passed as a reference to print() method.
    - Changed: else statement can not be written as ELSE IF, ELSE UNLESS or
      ELSE LOOP anymore (only ELSE and ELSE COND is allowed).
    - Fixed: non-default tags were sometimes not recognized in the template.
    - Fixed: pure ELSE and END caused an error without a space before
      the ending tag.

    - Added: option to include template files defined by a variable.

1.20  Sun May 11 02:42 2003
    - Added: if, else, unless and loop statements for a better control of the 
      template output and a cleaner template syntax.
    - Added: blind cache option for some speed improvement over normal caching.
    - Added: default loop context variables can be changed and are faster now.
    - Changed: chomp removes the newline before and after a block tag instead 
      of all preceding whitespace characters.
    - Changed: more detailed error messages and better syntax checking.
    - Fixed: inner loops had access to outer loop context variables what
      resulted in unexpected behavior.
    - Fixed: include function first checked the path to the enclosing file
      instead of the default file path.
